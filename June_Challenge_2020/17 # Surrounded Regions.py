# Given a 2D board containing 'X' and 'O' (the letter O), 
# capture all regions surrounded by 'X'.

# A region is captured by flipping all 'O's into 'X's in that surrounded region.

# Example:

# X X X X
# X O O X
# X X O X
# X O X X

# After running your function, the board should be:

# X X X X
# X X X X
# X X X X
# X O X X

# Explanation:

# Surrounded regions shouldnâ€™t be on the border, 
# which means that any 'O' on the border of the board are not flipped to 'X'. 
# Any 'O' that is not on the border and it is not connected to an 'O' on 
# the border will be flipped to 'X'. 
# Two cells are connected if they are adjacent cells connected horizontally or 
# vertically.

# ===============================================================================
# Accepted in Leetcode
# Approach:
# We check all the 'O' which are on border and with border
# and mark all those 'O' with some other character
# Now we run a loop - to change all left 'O' to 'X'
# and that another character back to 'O'
