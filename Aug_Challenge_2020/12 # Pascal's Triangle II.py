# Given a non-negative index k where k â‰¤ 33, 
# return the kth index row of the Pascal's triangle.

# Note that the row index starts from 0.

# In Pascal's triangle, each number is the sum of the two numbers directly above it.

# Example:

# Input: 3
# Output: [1,3,3,1]

# Follow up:

# Could you optimize your algorithm to use only O(k) extra space?

# Accepted in Leetcode

# Approach :
# We know output array will be of size rowIndex+1
# Now we need to updated the same array; rowIndex times
# and we start from top and to update particular element ; we will add two numbers directy
# above it i.e. of previous row.
